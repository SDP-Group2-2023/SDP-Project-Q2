The project can be used on UNIX-like systems (Linux, MacOS, etc.).

To compile the project, the procedure is:
- open a terminal in the project folder
- mkdir build  #to create a folder for the build
- cd build     #to enter the build folder
- cmake ..     #to create the makefile
- make         #to compile the project

In the build folder there will be the executable file "main" that can be run with the command:
- ./partitioner
